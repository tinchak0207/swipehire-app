## 🔄 Complete User Flow

### Step 1: Navigation Access
1. User clicks "Market Salary Inquiry" in the sidebar
2. System loads the salary inquiry page
3. User sees the form interface and getting started guide

### Step 2: Input Query Conditions
1. User fills out the salary query form:
   - Job title (text input)
   - Industry (dropdown)
   - Region (dropdown)
   - Experience level (dropdown)
   - Education level (dropdown)
   - Company size (dropdown)
2. Form validates input in real-time
3. User clicks "Search Salaries" to submit

### Step 3: Data Query and Analysis
1. System converts form data to query criteria
2. Sends request to salary data service
3. Service queries backend API with retry logic
4. Falls back to mock data if API unavailable
5. Returns structured salary data and statistics

### Step 4: Result Display and Interaction
1. System displays search summary with result count
2. Shows interactive visualization chart (bar/line/scatter)
3. Presents detailed data table with sorting/filtering
4. Displays statistical analysis (median, percentiles, etc.)
5. Users can:
   - Change chart types
   - Filter and sort data
   - Navigate through paginated results
   - Refresh data

### Step 5: Report Generation (Ready for Implementation)

- Custom report templates (planned)
- Email sharing capabilities (planned)

## 🛠 Technical Implementation Details

### Navigation Integration
```typescript
// Added to baseTabItems in src/app/page.tsx
{
  value: 'salaryEnquiry',
  label: 'Market Salary Inquiry',
  icon: DollarSign,
  component: (
    <MarketSalaryInquiryPage
      isGuestMode={isGuestModeActive}
      currentUserRole={fullBackendUser?.selectedRole || null}
    />
  ),
  description: 'Research market salary data and compensation trends',
  isNew: true,
  shortcut: '⌘S',
}
```

### Data Flow
```typescript
// Form submission → Query criteria → API call → Data display
SalaryQueryFormData → SalaryQueryCriteria → SalaryQueryResponse → UI Components
```

### Error Handling
- Network errors with automatic retry
- Validation errors with user feedback
- Rate limiting protection
- Fallback data for offline scenarios

### Performance Optimizations
- React Query caching (5-minute stale time)
- Dynamic component imports
- Memoized calculations
- Efficient re-renders
