## 🔧 **FIXED: Industry Events "No events found" Issue**

The issue was that the **EventService was pointing to the wrong URL**. Here's what I fixed:

### **❌ Problem:**
The `EventService` was trying to connect to:
```
BACKEND_URL/api/events  // Points to Express backend (not running)
```

### **✅ Solution:**
Updated `EventService` to use the frontend API routes:
```
/api/events  // Points to Next.js API routes (working)
```

### **🔧 What I Changed:**
1. **Updated EventService** (`/src/services/eventService.ts`):
   - Changed `BACKEND_URL` to `API_BASE = '/api'`
   - Now uses relative URLs: `/api/events` instead of `http://localhost:5000/api/events`
   - All methods now point to the frontend API routes

2. **Verified Mock Data**:
   - ✅ 12 comprehensive events in `/src/app/api/events/route.ts`
   - ✅ All event types, formats, and industries covered
   - ✅ Rich data with speakers, locations, pricing

### **🎯 Test the Fix:**

1. **Restart Development Server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   ```
   Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
   Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   ```

3. **Navigate to Industry Events**:
   - Go to sidebar → "Industry Events"
   - OR directly visit: `http://localhost:3000/events`

4. **Verify API Works**:
   - Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/events`
   - Should see JSON with 12 events

### **🎉 Expected Result:**
You should now see **12 diverse events** including:
- AI in Recruitment Conference
- Remote Work Culture Workshop
- Software Engineering Career Fair
- Women in Tech Leadership Summit
- Digital Marketing Bootcamp
- Startup Pitch Competition
- Cybersecurity Workshop
- Product Management Conference
- DevOps Meetup
- Data Science Summit
- UX/UI Design Workshop
- Sales Leadership Masterclass

### **🛠️ If Still Having Issues:**
1. Check browser console for any errors
2. Verify the API endpoint works: `http://localhost:3000/api/events`
3. Make sure you're on the correct port (3000 not 5000)

The events should now load correctly! 🚀
