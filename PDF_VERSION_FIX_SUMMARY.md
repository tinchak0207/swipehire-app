# PDF.js Version Mismatch Fix

## Problem
The application was encountering a PDF.js version mismatch error:
```
Error: The API version "5.3.31" does not match the Worker version "3.11.174".
```

This error occurred because:
1. The main PDF.js library was version 5.3.31 (from package.json)
2. The worker file was version 3.11.174 (outdated)
3. PDF.js requires the API and Worker versions to match exactly

## Root Cause
- The worker file in `public/workers/pdf.worker.min.js` was from an older version (3.11.174)
- The installed `pdfjs-dist` package was version 5.3.31
- In version 5.3.31, PDF.js changed the worker file extension from `.js` to `.mjs`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Worker File
- Replaced the outdated worker file with the correct version from `node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs`
- Copied it to `public/workers/pdf.worker.min.js` to maintain the existing path structure

### 2. Updated Fallback CDN URLs
Modified `src/services/fileParsingService.ts` to use the correct CDN URLs:
- Changed from `.js` to `.mjs` extension for version 5.3.31
- Updated fallback URLs to use unpkg and jsdelivr CDNs with correct file extensions

### 3. File Changes Made

#### Updated Files:
1. **`public/workers/pdf.worker.min.js`**
   - Replaced with version 5.3.31 worker file
   - File size: ~1MB (updated from older version)

2. **`src/services/fileParsingService.ts`**
   - Updated CDN fallback URLs to use `.mjs` extension
   - Changed from jsdelivr-only to unpkg + jsdelivr fallbacks
   - Removed outdated version 3.11.174 fallback

## Verification Steps

### Manual Testing:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to any page that uses PDF upload functionality
3. Try uploading a PDF file
4. Check browser console - the version mismatch error should be resolved

### Expected Results:
- ✅ No more "API version does not match Worker version" errors
- ✅ PDF parsing should work correctly
- ✅ Console should show "PDF.js initialized with local worker file"

### Browser Console Messages:
**Before Fix:**
```
Error: The API version "5.3.31" does not match the Worker version "3.11.174".
```

**After Fix:**
```
PDF.js initialized with local worker file
```

## Technical Details

### Version Compatibility:
- PDF.js API: 5.3.31
- PDF.js Worker: 5.3.31 ✅ (now matching)

### File Locations:
- Main library: `node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.mjs`
- Worker file: `public/workers/pdf.worker.min.js` (copied from `node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs`)

### Fallback Strategy:
1. **Primary**: Local worker file (`/workers/pdf.worker.min.js`)
2. **Fallback 1**: unpkg CDN (`https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@5.3.31/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs`)
3. **Fallback 2**: jsdelivr CDN (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/pdfjs-dist@5.3.31/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs`)

## Future Maintenance

### When Updating PDF.js:
1. Update the `pdfjs-dist` package: `npm update pdfjs-dist`
2. Copy the new worker file: `cp node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs public/workers/pdf.worker.min.js`
3. Update CDN URLs in `fileParsingService.ts` to match the new version
4. Test PDF functionality after updates

### Monitoring:
- Watch for PDF.js version updates in package updates
- Ensure worker file stays in sync with main library version
- Test PDF upload functionality after any PDF.js related updates

## Impact
This fix resolves the PDF parsing functionality across the application, including:
- Resume upload and parsing
- Document processing features
- Any other PDF-related functionality

The fix ensures reliable PDF processing without dependency on external CDNs for the worker file.
