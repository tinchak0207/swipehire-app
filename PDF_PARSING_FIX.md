# PDF Parsing Fix

## Issue Resolved
The PDF parsing was failing because of a version mismatch between the installed `pdfjs-dist` package (v5.3.31) and the hardcoded worker URL (v3.11.174).

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed PDF.js Worker Version
- **File**: `src/services/fileParsingService.ts`
- **Change**: Updated worker URL to use the correct version dynamically
- **Before**: `'https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@3.11.174/build/pdf.worker.min.js'`
- **After**: `` `https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@${pdfjsLib.version}/build/pdf.worker.min.js` ``

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added better error messages for different PDF parsing scenarios
- Improved initialization checks
- Added fallback handling for worker loading issues

### 3. Created Debug Tools
- **File**: `src/components/debug/PDFTestComponent.tsx` - Debug component for testing PDF parsing
- **File**: `src/app/debug/pdf-test/page.tsx` - Debug page accessible at `/debug/pdf-test`

## Testing the Fix

### Option 1: Use the Debug Page
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/debug/pdf-test`
3. Upload a PDF file to test the parsing functionality
4. Check the detailed output for any issues

### Option 2: Use the Main Upload Page
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/resume-optimizer/upload`
2. Upload a PDF file
3. Click "Extract Text" to test the parsing

## Expected Behavior
- PDF files should now parse correctly without the "corrupted or password-protected" error
- The worker should load with the correct version (5.3.31)
- Text extraction should work for standard PDF files
- Progress tracking should show real-time updates

## Troubleshooting

### If PDF parsing still fails:
1. **Check Internet Connection**: The PDF.js worker loads from CDN
2. **Try Different PDF**: Some PDFs may be image-based or have complex formatting
3. **Check Browser Console**: Look for specific error messages
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Force reload the page (Ctrl+F5)

### Common Issues:
- **Worker Loading Error**: Check network connectivity to unpkg.com
- **CORS Issues**: Ensure the CDN is accessible from your domain
- **Memory Issues**: Large PDF files may cause memory problems

### Fallback Options:
If CDN loading fails, you can:
1. Download the worker file locally to `public/workers/`
2. Update the worker URL to use the local file
3. Use a different CDN (jsdelivr, cdnjs)

## Version Information
- **pdfjs-dist**: 5.3.31 (installed)
- **Worker URL**: Dynamically matches package version
- **Mammoth**: Latest (for DOCX parsing)

## Next Steps
1. Test with various PDF files (text-based, scanned, complex layouts)
2. Monitor performance with large files
3. Consider adding OCR support for image-based PDFs
4. Implement caching for better performance
