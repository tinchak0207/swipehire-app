function ResumeEditor() {
  const [content, setContent] = useState('');
  
  const handleSuggestionGenerated = (suggestions) => {
    console.log('New suggestions:', suggestions);
  };
  
  const handleSuggestionApplied = (suggestionId) => {
    console.log('Applied suggestion:', suggestionId);
  };
  
  const handleContentUpdate = (newContent) => {
    setContent(newContent);
  };

  return (
    <SmartSuggestionsEngine
      content={content}
      targetRole="Software Engineer"

      enableMLSuggestions={true}
      onSuggestionGenerated={handleSuggestionGenerated}
      onSuggestionApplied={handleSuggestionApplied}
      onSuggestionDismissed={(id) => console.log('Dismissed:', id)}
      onContentUpdate={handleContentUpdate}
    />
  );
}
```

};

// Performance monitoring
const handleMetricsUpdate = (metrics) => {
  analytics.track('suggestions_generated', {
    processing_time: metrics.processingTime,
    suggestions_count: metrics.suggestionsGenerated,
    confidence_avg: metrics.confidenceAverage
  });
};

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Suggestions Not Generating
1. Check that `content` prop is not empty
2. Verify `targetIndustry` is supported
3. Ensure real-time mode is enabled or manual analysis is triggered
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### Poor Suggestion Quality
1. Verify `targetRole` and `targetIndustry` are accurate
2. Check `experienceLevel` matches the content
3. Ensure content has sufficient detail for analysis
4. Consider enabling ML suggestions for better results

#### Performance Issues
1. Disable real-time mode for very long documents
2. Reduce suggestion limits in component configuration
3. Check for memory leaks in suggestion management
4. Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large lists

### Debug Mode

```tsx
<SmartSuggestionsEngine
  // ... other props
  debug={true}
  onDebugInfo={(info) => console.log('Debug:', info)}
/>
```
