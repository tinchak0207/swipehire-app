# Market Salary Typeform Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a streamlined user experience for salary research by integrating a typeform-styled interface with comprehensive salary analysis. Users can now access salary data through an intuitive multi-step form that seamlessly transitions to detailed results.

## User Flow

### 1. Initial Access
- User clicks "Market Salary Inquiry" in the sidebar
- Sidebar remains visible throughout the entire process
- User is presented with a typeform-styled multi-step form

### 2. Form Completion
- **Step 1**: Job Title (Text input with validation)
- **Step 2**: Industry Selection (Visual cards with emojis)
- **Step 3**: Geographic Region (Location-based options)
- **Step 4**: Experience Level (Career progression stages)
- **Step 5**: Education Level (Academic qualifications)
- **Step 6**: Company Size (Organization scale)

### 3. Results Display
- Form submission triggers backend analysis
- Results page displays with comprehensive salary insights
- Users can start a new search or refresh data
- Sidebar navigation remains accessible

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created/Modified

#### 1. MarketSalaryTypeformPage.tsx
**Location**: `src/components/pages/MarketSalaryTypeformPage.tsx`

**Features**:
- State management for form/results toggle
- Integration with existing salary query hooks
- Responsive design with DaisyUI components
- Accessibility features and keyboard navigation
- Error handling and loading states
- Performance optimization with React Query

**Key Functions**:
- `handleFormSubmit()`: Processes typeform data and triggers analysis
- `convertFormDataToCriteria()`: Maps form data to backend query format
- `handleBackToForm()`: Allows users to start new searches
- `getSearchSummary()`: Generates human-readable search descriptions

#### 2. Updated page.tsx
**Location**: `src/app/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Replaced `MarketSalaryEnquiryPage` with `MarketSalaryTypeformPage`
- Added proper prop passing for `currentUserRole`
- Maintained existing navigation structure

### Data Flow

```
User Input (Typeform) → Form Validation → Data Conversion → Backend Query → Results Display
```

1. **Form Data Collection**: TypeformSalaryQuery component collects user inputs
2. **Data Validation**: Zod schema validation ensures data integrity
3. **Criteria Conversion**: Form data mapped to backend query criteria
4. **API Integration**: useSalaryQuery hook handles backend communication
5. **Results Rendering**: SalaryDataTable and SalaryVisualizationChart display insights

### Form Data Mapping

| Form Field | Backend Field | Mapping Logic |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| jobTitle | jobTitle | Direct mapping |
| industry | industry | Direct mapping |
| region | region | Direct mapping |
| experience | experienceLevel | entry-level → entry, mid-level → mid, etc. |
| education | education | high-school → high_school, bachelor → bachelor, etc. |
| companySize | companySize | startup → startup, small → small, etc. |

## Features

### User Experience

- **Animation System**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions

## Backend Integration

### API Endpoints Used
- **Salary Query**: `/api/salary-data` (via useSalaryQuery hook)
- **User Preferences**: Existing user context integration

### Data Processing
- Form validation using Zod schemas
- Automatic data type conversion
- Error boundary implementation
- Loading state management

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Sidebar navigation remains functional
- [ ] Form validation works for all fields
- [ ] Data submission triggers backend query
- [ ] Results page displays correctly
- [ ] "New Search" functionality works
- [ ] Error states display appropriately
- [ ] Loading states provide feedback
- [ ] Responsive design works on all devices

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for form validation
- Integration tests for data flow
- Component rendering tests
- API integration tests

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques
- **Lazy Loading**: Dynamic imports for heavy components
- **Memoization**: useCallback and useMemo for expensive operations
- **Query Caching**: React Query for efficient data fetching
- **Code Splitting**: Separate bundles for different features

### Metrics to Monitor
- Form completion rate
- Time to results display
- Error rate and types
- User engagement with results

## Accessibility Features

### WCAG Compliance
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Color Contrast**: Meets WCAG AA standards
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order

### Inclusive Design
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript
- **Responsive Text**: Scales with user preferences
- **Error Recovery**: Clear paths to resolve issues
- **Alternative Formats**: Multiple ways to access information

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Save Search History**: Allow users to revisit previous searches
2. **Export Results**: PDF/CSV export functionality
3. **Comparison Tool**: Compare multiple salary searches
4. **Alerts System**: Notify users of salary trend changes
5. **Advanced Filters**: More granular search criteria
6. **Social Sharing**: Share salary insights with others

### Technical Debt
- Consider extracting form logic to custom hooks
- Implement more comprehensive error boundaries
- Add performance monitoring and analytics
- Enhance TypeScript types for better developer experience

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
- Ensure all existing environment variables are maintained
- No new environment variables required for this feature

### Build Process
- No changes to existing build configuration
- Component is included in main bundle
- Dynamic imports handle code splitting automatically

### Monitoring
- Monitor form completion rates
