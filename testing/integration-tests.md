# Integration Testing Strategy

- **Framework:** Cypress
- **Focus:** Interactions between components and APIs.
- **Examples:**
  - Test that creating a new workflow via the UI correctly calls the backend API.
  - Test that dragging and dropping a card onto the canvas updates the workflow state.
  - Test that the entire workflow execution process works end-to-end.
