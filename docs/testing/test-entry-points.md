I have successfully implemented entry points for the Resume Optimization Tool as specified in Task #12. Here's what was added:

### 1. AI Tools Page Entry Point

- **Changes Made**:
  - Added `FileText` icon import
  - Added `resumeOptimizer` to the `ToolKey` type
  - Added a new tool card for "Résumé Optimization Tools" at the top of the tools grid
  - Configured the card with:
    - Title: "Résumé Optimization Tools"
    - Icon: FileText (from Lucide React)
    - Background: Blue gradient (`bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 to-indigo-600`)
    - Description: "AI-powered resume analysis, ATS optimization, and personalized suggestions to boost your job prospects."
    - onClick handler: Navigates to `/resume-optimizer`

### 2. My Profile Page Entry Point
- **Location**: `src/components/pages/MyProfilePage.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:

  - Added a new card section titled "Résumé Optimization Tools"
  - Included features showcase with badges for:
    - ATS Optimization
    - Keyword Analysis
    - Grammar Check
    - Format Suggestions
  - Added a prominent button that:
    - Shows "Optimize My Resume" for logged-in users
    - Shows "Sign In to Optimize Resume" for guest users
    - Navigates to `/resume-optimizer` when clicked

### 3. Technical Implementation Details
- **Navigation**: Used `next/link` for client-side navigation via `router.push('/resume-optimizer')`
- **Accessibility**: 
  - Proper ARIA attributes through semantic HTML
  - Clear button text and descriptions
  - Keyboard navigation support through DaisyUI components
- **Responsive Design**: Both entry points are responsive and work on mobile and desktop
- **Guest Mode Handling**: Appropriate handling for guest users with disabled states and sign-in prompts

### 4. User Experience Features
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Both entry points are prominently placed and visually distinct
- **Descriptive Content**: Clear descriptions of what the resume optimizer offers
- **Feature Highlights**: Badges and descriptions that explain the value proposition
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches the existing design system using DaisyUI classes

## Testing Instructions

To test the implementation:

1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to AI Tools page**: Click on "AI Tools" in the navigation
   - Verify the "Résumé Optimization Tools" card appears at the top
   - Click the card to navigate to `/resume-optimizer`
3. **Navigate to My Profile page**: Click on "My Profile" in the navigation
   - Scroll down to find the "Résumé Optimization Tools" section
   - Click "Optimize My Resume" button to navigate to `/resume-optimizer`
4. **Test guest mode**: Sign out and verify guest users see appropriate messaging

## Route Verification

The entry points navigate to `/resume-optimizer` which was already implemented in Task #11. The route includes:
- Main landing page with three options: Upload, Import, Create
- Individual pages for each workflow
- Complete resume optimization functionality

## Compliance with Requirements
